# BBC-News-Article-Genre-Predictor

The main purpose of this project is to investigate the performance of different ML supervised learning algorithms for article classification on BBC news datasets using NB, kNN, SVM and NNs.

The data has been preprocessed using the "Preprocessing" script to be a comma-separated line with three columns: news ID, processed news body, news class. The news bodies have preprocessed by tokenization and lower-cased with removal of stop words and special characters and textual feature extraction. 

The preprocessed data has subsequently been split into a training and test dataset. 

The code for the exploratory data analysis, the implementation of the supervised models and their F1 score calculation can be found in the Article Classification Code, and the explanation of the analysis can be found in the Analysis report.
